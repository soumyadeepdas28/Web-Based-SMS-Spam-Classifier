This repository contains a web-based SMS spam classifier built using Flask. The classifier uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a given SMS message is spam or not. The dataset used for training and testing the model is publicly available and can be found at this repository. The app allows users to input an SMS message and receive a prediction of whether it is spam or not. The app also includes a user-friendly interface and the ability to continuously update and improve the model's accuracy. Feel free to use and modify the code for your own projects.
